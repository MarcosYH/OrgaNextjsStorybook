This is a monorepo with nextjs and storybook component project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm --filter front install 
#and
pnpm --filter ui install

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result font.
Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser to see the ui.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx` for front. The page auto-updates as you edit the file and start editing the component with ui folder.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
